Over the last week, MATIC has grown by almost 5%. In addition, the token is trading in an approximate horizontal channel within the medium-to-long term. The apparent result is investor indecision and a wait-and-see mode for clearer direction signals. But a a breakout from this channel would be bullish and indicate gains, and breaking the same would be bearish. The currency is currently testing resistance at the $0.72 level. Historically, trading volumes have been on the higher side for price peaks and lower with respect to price troughs, supporting strength in the currency and suggesting a break out to the upside is more likely. Polygon is trading at $0.711488 at the time of writing. The cryptocurrency has been trading at a volume of $415.27 million over the last 24 hours in circulation and currently stands at a market cap of $5.70 billion. Over the past day, the token has added about 0.19% in value to its price. Analyst Eyes $1.30 For MATIC In the Coming Weeks In a recent update, renowned crypto analyst World Of Charts expressed optimism regarding the future price performance of MATIC. The analyst pointed out a significant development in MATIC’s price action, indicating a potential solid recovery towards $1.30 in the coming weeks. The breakthrough moment arrived as MATIC successfully exited a descending channel consolidation, a pattern that has been constraining its price movement. This event has sparked enthusiasm among investors and analysts alike, signaling a shift in sentiment towards the cryptocurrency. Analyst Jonathan Carter also commented on MATIC’s price action, unveiling a precedent in market behavior that has been persisting for more than two years. The token has been within this massive triangle pattern, which analysts have read as an accumulation zone. This pattern implies investors have slowly added to their bags of MATIC tokens in the hopes of a bullish breakout. Carter said patience was key when dealing with MATIC’s price actions and added that breakouts from such patterns may take time to materialize. Nevertheless, he remained optimistic about the cryptocurrency over the long run and indicated it could record significant gains once the breakout happened.

Amid this environment, bull runs—periods of sustained price increases and heightened market confidence—offer lucrative opportunities for investors. One analyst, renowned for his accurate market predictions, has recently highlighted three cryptocurrencies he is bullish on for the 2024 bull run: Polkadot (DOT), Polygon (MATIC), and Retik Finance (RETIK). This article delves into the reasons behind his bullish stance on these three coins, exploring their fundamentals, recent developments, and potential for substantial gains. Understanding the 2024 Bull Run A bull run in the cryptocurrency market is a period marked by a continuous increase in asset prices, driven by rising investor confidence and inflows of new capital. During such times, the demand for cryptocurrencies increases, often leading to substantial price surges. This environment not only benefits investors with significant returns but also accelerates the development and adoption of various projects within the crypto space. The anticipated 2024 bull run is expected to follow these trends, presenting a prime opportunity for strategic investments. Polkadot (DOT): Bridging Blockchain Networks Polkadot (DOT) is well-positioned to excel in the 2024 bull run due to its strong fundamentals and expanding adoption. With a current market capitalization of $12 billion and a circulating supply of 987 million tokens, DOT is primed for significant price appreciation. Polkadot&#8217;s unique interoperability protocol allows different blockchain networks to communicate and share data, a feature that is increasingly valuable as the decentralized finance (DeFi) market grows. Given these factors, the analyst predicts that Polkadot&#8217;s price could surge to 20 times its current value, reaching approximately $145 from its present price of $7.25. This optimistic forecast is grounded in Polkadot&#8217;s role as a critical bridge in the blockchain ecosystem, its expanding user base, and the increasing number of projects leveraging its interoperability features. Polygon (MATIC): Scaling Ethereum&#8217;s Ecosystem Over the past year, Polygon&#8217;s price has surged over 200%, showcasing its resilience and potential for further appreciation. The platform&#8217;s development activity has also been on the rise, with a notable 30% increase in GitHub commits over the past quarter. This uptick in development signals ongoing innovation and improvements, bolstering Polygon&#8217;s position in the market. Polygon&#8217;s scalability solutions and growing adoption in the DeFi and NFT spaces position it for substantial gains. As more projects seek to leverage its efficient and low-cost infrastructure, Polygon&#8217;s ecosystem continues to expand. The analyst projects that Polygon&#8217;s price could achieve a 30x return on investment, potentially reaching $21.27 from its current trading price of $0.7089. Retik Finance (RETIK): Disrupting the DeFi Space Retik Finance (RETIK) has quickly captured the attention of savvy investors, experiencing remarkable growth from $0.030 to $0.12 in a short period. The excitement around Retik Finance (RETIK) is set to peak with its upcoming exchange listing on May 21, 2024, at a listing price of $0.15 on Uniswap and other major exchanges. Unlike many projects that replicate existing DeFi protocols, Retik Finance seeks to disrupt the market with practical solutions and tangible benefits for users. Its innovative approach has garnered a strong following and a robust community, setting the stage for significant price appreciation upon its exchange listing The analyst predicts that Retik Finance (RETIK) could see its price skyrocket to $7.50 from the listing price of $0.15, representing a 50x rise. This optimistic outlook is based on Retik Finance&#8217;s unique value proposition, market excitement, and the upcoming listing event, which is expected to drive significant demand for the token. Conclusion The anticipated 2024 bull run in the cryptocurrency market is expected to bring significant opportunities for investors. Polkadot (DOT), Polygon (MATIC), and Retik Finance (RETIK) are three cryptocurrencies that an analyst, known for his accurate market predictions, has identified as poised for substantial gains. Polkadot&#8217;s interoperability and expanding ecosystem, Polygon&#8217;s scalability solutions and growth in DeFi and NFTs, and Retik Finance&#8217;s innovative approach to disrupting the DeFi space with its anticipated launch position these coins for remarkable appreciation. As the market enters this bullish phase, strategic investments in these projects could yield substantial returns for informed and agile investors.

SHIB saw 82 large transactions totaling 1.7 trillion SHIB in the past 24 hours, but trading volume is low. Shiba Inu, the meme-inspired cryptocurrency, has garnered significant attention in the crypto market. After experiencing a tumultuous ride in 2021, marked by an astronomical surge followed by a steep decline, Shiba Inu is now making strides towards reclaiming its position in the market. In 2024, the token has witnessed a resurgence, with its value surging by 120%, outperforming major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. This prompts investors to ponder whether Shiba Inu can ascend to the coveted $0.001 mark from its current valuation of $0.0000248. Despite its recent performance, Shiba Inu faces hurdles to mainstream adoption. One of the primary obstacles lies in its limited utility in real-world transactions. Data reveals that only 933 merchants accept Shiba Inu, underscoring its struggle to gain traction compared to more established cryptocurrencies. Although initiatives like Shibarium aim to enhance transaction efficiency through a Layer-2 blockchain solution, widespread acceptance remains elusive. Shiba Inu&#8217;s meteoric rise in 2021 was fueled by speculation, with investors banking on its exponential growth. However, the subsequent crash highlighted the risks associated with speculative investments. Whale Transactions and Market Activity In the past 24 hours, Shiba Inu has recorded 82 large transactions, totaling a significant 1.7 trillion SHIB tokens. While these transactions may seem substantial initially, further analysis reveals a lack of consistent buying interest. Transaction volume has dipped to $40.48 million, considerably lower than the recent seven-day high of $223.76 million. This decline in trading activity suggests a potential consolidation phase for SHIB. Despite the promising increase in burn rate, SHIB&#8217;s price has experienced notable fluctuations in recent trading sessions. Currently trading at $0.00002401, the token has seen a decline of 2.44%. With a market capitalization of $14.16B, Shiba Inu holds the 11th position among cryptocurrencies by market cap. The 24-hour trading volume has surged by 16.51%, reaching $374.56. This uptick in trading volume indicates robust market activity and heightened investor interest in SHIB. Mixed sentiments prevail in the market, as evidenced by the conflicting data on derivatives volume and open interest (OI). While derivatives volume surged by 21.61%, SHIB&#8217;s OI experienced an 8.13% decline. This disparity suggests increased trading activity accompanied by reduced money inflow, contributing to SHIB&#8217;s current market volatility. Bullish Signs on the Charts Market analysts have identified a bullish pennant pattern on the Shiba Inu chart, indicating the potential for significant profits. This pattern suggests that SHIB might resume its upward climb following a consolidation period. Analysts foresee potential profits of over 62% in the near future. Clifton, a prominent Bitcoin analyst, has highlighted the formation of a bullish pennant on Shiba Inu’s 24-hour timeframe. According to Clifton, this pattern suggests that SHIB could soon experience a breakout, potentially yielding holders a short-term profit of up to 60%. $SHIB (Update) Bullish Pennant Formation in Daily Timeframe&#8230; In Case of Upside Breakout We Can See 50 &#8211; 60% Bullish Rally#SHIBUSDT #SHIB #Crypto pic.twitter.com/XRTtPDnjRr &mdash; Clifton Fx (@clifton_ideas) May 19, 2024'}, {'title': 'Shiba Inu Price Set for Surge: Analysts Predict 50%-60% Rally', 'date': '2024-05-20T16:30:00.000Z', 'source': 'https://tronweekly.com', 'url': 'https://www.tronweekly.com/shiba-inu-price-surge-analysts-predict-50-60/', 'summary': 'Shiba Inu (SHIB), the famous meme-based cryptocurrency, is gearing up for a massive value pump. Just now, SHIB has managed to hold the waves above its support and is recovering from $0.00002159. The challenging task for SHIB remains to conquer the critical resistance level, oscillating around $0.000025. However, a decisive move above this resistance could pave the way for a substantial price rally. Shiba Inu prices traded at $0.00002395 at press time, accounting for a 24-hour trading volume of $264.84 million and a market capitalization of $14.11 billion. The SHIB price has gone down by 4.28% over the last 24 hours but has gained a positive pace in the last week to surge above 10%. Analyst Predicts Shiba Inu 50%-60% Price Surge Crypto analyst Clifton FX recently shared a bullish outlook on Shiba Inu’s future price movements, highlighting a promising technical pattern. According to Clifton, the $SHIB token is forming a bullish pennant on the daily timeframe. In addition, a bullish pennant is a continuation pattern that typically indicates a period of consolidation before a breakout in the direction of the prevailing trend. Clifton FX suggests that if SHIB breaks out from this pattern to the upside, it could trigger a significant rally, potentially increasing the token’s value by 50-60%. Moreove\\xadr, Changelly has provided its latest pre\\xaddiction for Shiba Inu’s price, mirroring the optimistic view of Clifton FX. Change\\xadlly anticipates that by May 21, 2024, SHIB will rise by 15.08%, arriving at a price of $0.00002755. This proje\\xadction is backed by multiple technical tools that Change\\xadlly utilizes to gauge market se\\xadntiment and price trends. Changelly Technical Analysis Indicators point at a 55% status of neutral bullish with regard to Shiba Inu. As much as the indicators are not over-optimistic, market sentiment keeps a little positive bias. Besides, the Fear & Greed Index records around 72 points, corresponding to the “Greed.” Often, high scores of Greed indicate that investors become more confident and willing to take risks in an advancing market environment, typically pushing prices higher.

Over the period from May 1 to May 16, holders increased their DOGE holdings by 30 million tokens. Courtesy: Santiment Another popular crypto analyst Kaleo noted that during the 2021 GameStop rally, the Dogecoin price started rallying soon after the GME stock price topped.
